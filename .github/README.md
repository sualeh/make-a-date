- Includes fully working code examples from the presentation 
- Includes solutions to [Questions and Exercises: Date-Time API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/QandE/questions.html)
- Uses JUnit tests to explain how the code should behave.

(See [Time Zones](TimeZones.md) for a quiz question on time-zones.)
